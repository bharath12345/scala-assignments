My submissions to Prof Martin Odersky's course on 'Functional Programming' on Coursera

The honor code of coursera says that the submissions should not be shared. So please note that these are NOT my final submissions. At max, a passing reader may use it for hints/guideline. But if you submit the same, then, your grades will be all screwed up!
